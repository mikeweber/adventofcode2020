# Day 6

## Part 1
Part 1 of the [customs declaration form problem](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/6)
felt pretty uninspired, but it set up part 2 pretty well. This was one where I would have
been a lot more comfortable with Ruby and I think it shows in my solution. So far, adding
part 2 has been as easy as looking at the data in new way that re-uses my code from part 1.
This time, I had to essentially write the part 2 solution from scratch. Some of the
concepts were similar, but the way of tracking each answer completely changed. This was
because of my discomfort with Rust and HashMaps in particular.

## Big O Notation
O(n)

## What did I learn?
I got a little more comfortable with HashMaps. I love using Hashes in Ruby for this kind
of problem, so I'm glad to get some reps in Rust. I would love to find out that Rust has
a similar way of setting default values for undefined HashMap keys the same way that Ruby
does, but that's probably unecessary with Rust's explicit matchers when retrieving values.
